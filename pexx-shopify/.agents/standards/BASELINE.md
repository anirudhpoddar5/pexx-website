## 1. Definition of Done

Work is finished when it is finished, not when it is ready to be checked. The
owner is not a QA step. Nothing below is optional, and they run in order:

1. **The build passes.** Run it. Not "should compile".
2. **Verified in a real browser** (or the real runtime, for a script). Load the
   page, click the thing, see the result. Never report "this should work" —
   say what was checked and what was seen.
3. **Help / FAQ updated** if a user would notice the change. A new screen,
   route or workflow is not done until the in-app help describes it in plain
   language, matching the existing sections.
4. **A test added or updated from the user's point of view** — browser-driven,
   clicking through the flow as a person would. If the UI genuinely does not
   offer an action (no delete button, append-only by design), do not fabricate
   a test for it; write one line saying why.
5. **Guard harnesses green.** Where a project has them (StitchLogic:
   `npm run harness`), they run and pass. Each one guards a rule that already
   broke once.
6. **A plain-English summary written** for the owner — see §2.
7. **Only then deploy.**

If any step is skipped, say which and why, in the summary. A skipped step named
out loud is a decision; a skipped step left silent is a defect handed over.

## 2. Writing for the owner

He is **not a coder**. Every substantive message ends with a short plain-English
summary covering: what it means, what he must do, what it costs, what is
waiting on him.

- **Lead with the consequence, not the mechanism.** "Excel was showing ₹12.50
  as 13" beats "the numFmt was applied unconditionally".
- Say plainly what is blocked, what needs a decision, and what needs nothing.
- Never present a guess as a finding. State what was verified, and how.
- Flag anything that touches live customers or costs money **before** doing it.
- No jargon and no code in the summary section.

---

## 3. Secrets

- No credential ever enters a repository — not in code, not in test fixtures,
  not in saved browser/session state.
- Real `.env` files are gitignored; only `*.example` files are tracked.
- **Ignore directories, not individual filenames.** *2026-08-10: Playwright's
  saved login state, holding a live Supabase session token, sat committed for
  months. The gitignore rule directly above it listed three files by name and
  missed two others in the same directory.*
- A committed token stays valid until the password is changed. Rotating is the
  fix; deleting the file is not.

---

## 4. Deployment

- Deploys come from `main`. **Merging to `main` is shipping to real users.**
- Being committed is not being deployed. *2026-06-13: a performance fix sat on
  an unmerged branch while production ran the old code, and the problem was
  reported as unfixed.* Verify: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> main`.
- Users need a hard refresh to pick up a new bundle.
- Run the package manager's install after editing `package.json`; a stale
  lockfile fails every build.
- Never deploy into a degraded backend — a new bug and an outage are
  indistinguishable while it is down.
- Do not commit or push unless asked. Leave work in the tree and report it.

---

## 5. Verifying work

- **A class name that does not exist fails silently and looks fine in review.**
  *2026-08-10: 64 numeric table columns used a `tabular` class that was never
  defined; figures rendered misaligned everywhere.* Confirm a class resolves in
  the built CSS before trusting it.
- Tailwind cannot see class names assembled at runtime. Tone/status maps must
  be static objects, not string concatenation.
- Non-trivial pure logic leaves one runnable check behind — the smallest thing
  that fails if the logic breaks. See StitchLogic's `scripts/*-harness.mjs`.
- Test failures fall into three recurring **non-bug** classes: network outage,
  expired session, latency flake. Establish which before chasing a defect.
- **A green suite proves nothing until you prove the thing under test was
  running.** *2026-08-20 (Ethica): a full-suite run reported "95 passed" and
  exit 0 with the dev server not running at all.* Two faults, either sufficient
  alone — nothing checked the server was up, and `run_tests.sh 2>&1 | tail -60`
  reports the exit status of `tail`, not of the runner. Before trusting a
  browser-suite result: curl the base URL, and read the backend ref the server
  actually injected rather than the name of the launch config that started it.
- **A count of tests that "did not run" is a failed run, whatever the exit code
  says.** So is a runtime far below the suite's usual. Both were on screen in
  the case above, underneath the word "passed".

## 6. Build for a thousand companies, not for ours

**Owner's instruction, 2026-08-26, after it was breached three times in one
session:** *"ANY DECISION U MAKE, KEEP IT COMPANY AGNOSTIC AND BUILT FOR 1000
COMPANIES!! NOT JUST ONE. IF ANYTHING U FEEL IS GETTING VERY SPECIFIC, BEST TO
DEVELOP AS CUSTOMIZATION/FLEXIBLE BUILD."*

StitchLogic, Ethica and Vetro are public multi-tenant products. The owner's own
factory is ONE tenant and it is the tenant whose data you can see, which is
exactly why it keeps getting mistaken for the requirement.

- **Never decide from one tenant's data.** Do not ask "does your data have X?"
  to decide whether to build X, and do not query a live account to "see the
  size" — first ask whether the answer could change the build. It usually
  cannot. Decide from the RULE: if the rule is that a field drives a
  calculation, then a missing value fires a warning, whether today's count is
  zero or three hundred.
- **Never remove a feature because our account does not use it.** A field the
  owner leaves empty is a field another company fills daily. It renders blank,
  or hides itself for a tenant with no data — it does not leave the product.
- **Anything that varies by company is derived at runtime from that company's
  own configuration**, never hardcoded from ours: pipeline stages and their
  column labels from `pipeline_stages.short_code`, units from `factories`,
  shift columns from `companies.entry_mode`, buyers from `buyers`, compliance
  sections from that tenant's own set. A screen must be correct for a
  single-unit sewing-only workshop and a seven-stage multi-unit exporter, from
  the same code.
- **When a requirement genuinely is specific, build it as configuration, not as
  a branch.** A settings toggle, a per-tenant row, a preset the company picks —
  not an `if (company.name === …)`, not a constant that happens to match one
  factory's process, and not a column set copied from one customer's
  spreadsheet. A customer's spreadsheet is a FORMAT reference: take its shape,
  generate its columns from the tenant's own config.
- **Sample-of-one is a review question.** Before calling anything done: what does
  this do for a company configured differently from ours? Write the answer down.

This is about BREADTH — many companies, configured differently. It is distinct
from, and additional to, §5's volume concern (10x/100x rows).

---

## 7. Standards hygiene

- Canonical standards live in `~/Projects/standards/`. Each repo carries a
  committed copy at `.agents/standards/` because a cloud session clones one
  repo and can see nothing outside it.
- **Never edit a repo copy.** Edit the canonical file, then
  `node ~/Projects/standards/sync.mjs --write`.
- `node ~/Projects/standards/sync.mjs` checks and **exits non-zero on drift**.
  Run it before a deploy. *Three copies of the design language drifted once and
  had to be reconciled by hand (2026-08-09).*
- Each repo's `AGENTS.md` is its entry point; `CLAUDE.md` points at it. Product
  specifics belong in the repo, never here.

---

## 8. Review block

**Last reviewed: 2026-08-26 — re-check quarterly (next: 2026-11-26).**

At each review, check and date the answers:

- **(a) New free tools worth adopting.** What is now free or cheap that was not
  — hosting, test infrastructure, model access, monitoring, error tracking?
  Anything currently paid for that has a free equivalent good enough to switch?
- **(b) New prompting and model guidance.** Which models are current, what has
  changed in how to instruct them, and does anything in these files now
  contradict published guidance? Long instruction files measurably reduce how
  well instructions are followed — if a rule no longer changes behaviour, cut
  it. Aim to leave each review with fewer lines, not more.

Log the outcome as a dated line here so staleness stays visible.

- 2026-08-10 — Files created. Folded the former `ENGINEERING.md` into this file
  and `PRODUCT-TRIO.md`; switched from link-only to synced committed copies
  because cloud sessions cannot read outside their repo.

## A comment claiming a safety property is a claim, not evidence

Added 19 Aug 2026 after this pattern cost real time five times in one day, across
two products.

`20260819000010` carried a comment asserting that a branch of
`protect_profile_privileged_fields()` was NULL-safe. It was not — `IS DISTINCT
FROM` returns TRUE, not NULL, when one side is NULL, so every server-side role
change was failing under service-role. The next migration copied the branch
verbatim, trusting the comment, and inherited the bug.

**A comment that asserts a safety property the code does not have is worse than
no comment**, because it converts "I should check this" into "someone already
checked this".

The same shape in three other forms the same day:

- A filtered search reported as exhaustive. `grep` over `*compliance*.sql` found
  no write policies on a shared table and was reported as "Ethica has none" — they
  existed, in a file named differently. **The catalogue is the answer to "does this
  policy exist", never a filename pattern.**
- A cause inferred from reading a diff, twice, and wrong both times. **Only
  reverting the suspected file and re-running settles a failure's cause.**
- A verification run against a path the tool does not write to, then reported as
  proof of no damage.

**The rule:** when you write a comment claiming something is safe, name what you
ran to establish it. When you read one, treat it as a claim by someone who may
have been as busy as you are. And when you fix one branch of a guard, test the
branches you did not change — on 19 Aug that turned three assertions into nine,
and six of them had never been run.

## After you edit a test, an improving number is as much a signal as a worsening one

Recorded 20 Aug 2026 from a real incident, because it is the one direction
everything else in this file does not guard.

Three full runs of the same 59 tests: **46 pass / 10 fail**, then **55 / 1**, then
**54 / 2**. Between the first and second, the agent corrected several tests that
were asserting behaviour shipped earlier that day. One correction relaxed an
assertion far enough that a **real product bug** passed through it — a negative
balance shown when a factory over-produces. Nothing errored. The suite simply got
greener.

**The number improved because the measuring instrument got weaker.**

What the agent did next is the behaviour worth copying: **it treated its own
improvement as suspicious.** It had changed tests, the count moved the right way,
and instead of banking it, it went back and asked which of its edits could have
caused it. It found the one, reverted it, and reported **54/2 — a worse number it
could defend over a better one it could not.**

**The rule: after you edit a test, a failure count that improves deserves exactly
the same scrutiny as one that worsens — and it is the more dangerous of the two,
because a red run gets investigated and a green one gets shipped.**

**The caveat, so this is not applied where it cannot bite:** it only applies when
the *same* pass both edits tests and reports a number. An agent that only runs
tests cannot cause it. The trigger is precisely *"I changed the measuring
instrument and the measurement improved."*

Everything else recorded this week guards the opposite direction — stale claims,
colliding runs, causes inferred from a diff — all of which make a run look worse
than the truth, or make a green run meaningless. This one makes a green run
actively misleading.
